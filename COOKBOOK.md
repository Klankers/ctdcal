# ODF-CTD-PROC Cookbook

This cookbook attempts to provide instrutions on how to use the ODF-CTD-PROC Utlities for interpreting and processing raw data files from Seabird Electronic SBE9, SBE9+ and similar CTD sensor packages.  This cookbook also provides some best practices for using ODF-CTD-PROC at-sea during CTD-heavy cruises where adopting a more assembly-line type operating model is required to maintain sanity.

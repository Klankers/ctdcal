# ODF-CTD-PROC Cookbook

This cookbook attempts to provide instrutions on how to use the ODF-CTD-PROC Utlities for interpreting and processing raw data files from Seabird Electronic SBE9, SBE9+ and similar CTD sensor packages.  This cookbook also provides some best practices for using ODF-CTD-PROC at-sea during CTD-heavy cruises where adopting a more assembly-line type operating model is required to maintain sanity.

## Before we begin:
 - Please take a look at [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for instructions on how to install the ORD-CTD-PROC Utilites.
 - Please take a look at [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for recommendation on how to setup the SBE CTD Hardware and SBE Data Acquisition software.
